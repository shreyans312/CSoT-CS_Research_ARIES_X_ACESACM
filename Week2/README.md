# **MLP implementation using PyTorch:**
I have implemented a 4 Layer neural network in pytorch which has the following no. of neurons: Layer1-512, Layer2-256, Layer3-128, Layer4-64.
Further I have run the model for 40 epochs and the below are the results I obtained.

# **Single Layer NN implementation using Numpy:**
I have implemented a single layer neural network i.e. 10 neurons one for each output.
The following are all the results I obtained on running the nn for 40 epochs.
